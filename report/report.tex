\chapter{Introduction}
\section{The capacitated vehicle routing problem}
Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are some of the most well-studied and widely-applied optimization problems. The first definitions of VRP were presented by Dantzig et al. \cite{dantzig1959truck} in 1959. In general, VRPs seek to find an optimal set of tours for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers. Optimality may refer to minimizing costs, or maximizing overall profits. This abstraction covers a wide variety of application domains, including transportation, logistics, operations, etc \dots

Since its conception, a number of variants of the VRP have been proposed through the years. These variants account for different constraints as well as optimization goals. Popular VRP variants include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP): vehicles have capacity constraints;
	\item Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW): customers have time windows outside of which they cannot be serviced;
	\item Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits (VRPP): customers have profit values, and may not be serviced;
	\item etc \dots
\end{itemize}

This report focuses on solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem. CVRP is one of the most basic VRP variants. The problem considers a set of $n$ customers, each with a demand value $d_i$. Conversely, each vehicle has a capacity $C$, which is uniform among all vehicles. The CVRP states that no route can have a total demand (the sum of all customers' demands) exceeding the capacity $C$. Vehicle routes always start and end at a pre-determined location, called the depot. We seek a set of $k \leq n$ valid routes such that all customers are serviced \textit{exactly} once, and the total cost is minimized. Commonly, the depot and customer locations are set on a 2D space, where moving from location $A$ to location $B$ incurs a cost equal to the Euclidean distance between $A$ and $B$. Figure \ref{fig:prob_example} shows an example of CVRP input and solution.

\section{Formulation}
Formally, the CVRP is defined as (\cite{borcinova2017two}):

\begin{equation}
    min \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0, i \neq j}^n c_{ij}x_{rij} \label{eq:form1}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{align}
    \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i=0,i \neq j}^n x_{rij} = 1 \ & \forall j \in \{1, \dots, n\} \label{eq:form2} \\
    \sum_{j=1}^n x_{r0j} = 1 \ & \forall r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form3} \\
    \sum_{i=0,i \neq j} x_{rij} = \sum_{i=0} x_{rji} \ & \forall j \in \{1, \dots, n\},\ r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form4} \\
    \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=1,i \neq j} d_j x_{rij} \leq Q \ & \forall r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form5} \\
    \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S, i \neq j} x_{rij} \geq |S| - 1 \ & \forall S \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\} \label{eq:form6} \\
    x_{rij} \in \{ 0, 1 \} \ & \forall i,j \in \{0, \dots, n\},\ r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form7}
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$ is the set of locations. $0$ is the depot, where vehicles must start and end their routes;
	\item $p$ is the maximum number of vehicles. If not specified, we can let $p = n$;
	\item $c_{ij}$ is the cost of including edge $(i, j)$ in a route, or the cost incurred when moving from from $i$ to $j$;
	\item $x_{rij}$ is the binary variable signifying whether the edge $(i,j)$ is included in route $r$;
	\item $d_j$ denotes the demand for location $j$;
	\item $Q$ is the vehicle capacity.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Clarke-Wright algorithm}
The Clarke-Wright algorithm, sometimes referred to as the savings algorithm, is a very simple method for generating a valid solution to the CVRP. This is a greedy heuristic that is not optimal, but is often used as the basis for many metaheuristic algorithms.

The Clarke-Wright algorithm defines a savings value for each edge $(i,j)$:
\[
	s_{ij} = c_{i0} + c_{0j} - c_{ij}
\]

An edge's savings value denotes the amount of "cost" that can be saved by replacing two routes, $(0, i, 0)$ and $(0, j, 0)$ with a new route $(0, i, j, 0)$.

The algorithm first calculates the savings for each non-depot edge, then sorts them in a descending order, forming the savings list. $n$ routes are created, each starting at the depot, visits one customer, then returns. Then, the savings list is iterated one-by-one. For each edge $(i, j)$, check for 3 conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $i$ and $j$ must not be on the same route;
	\item $i$ and $j$ must still be connected to the depot on each of their routes;
	\item Merging the routes containing $i$ and $j$ will not violate the capacity constraints.
\end{enumerate}

If all 3 conditions are met, the routes containing $i$ and $j$ are merged, by appending $j$ after $i$ and then returning to the depot.

Each route join in the Clarke-Wright algorithm is guaranteed to improve the solution by the amount of edge savings. However, the greedy ordering is non-optimal, meaning we are likely to skip edges that would otherwise be part of the optimal solution.

\chapter{Tabu search and CVRP}
\section{Tabu search}

\section{SimpleTabu}
This section describes SimpleTabu, a tabu search for solving the CVRP. SimpleTabu is a full tabu search with 3 phases: short-term, intensification, and diversification.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The short-term phase performs a search using only the tabu list, excluding previous moves from the search to avoid local minima;
	\item The intensification phase selects a promising area in the search and explores it further, becoming more lenient with local minima;
	\item The diversification phase tries to move the search to a new, unexplored area, in order to find more promising solutions.
\end{itemize}

The search procedure starts with an initial solution. The short-term phase is run first, in which long-term memory objects are updated. Upon termination, a new initial solution is selected to start the intensification phase. After this phase, another initial solution is created for diversification.

\subsection{Initialization}
SimpleTabu uses the Clarke-Wright algorithm to create its initial solution. However, the original Clarke-Wright algorithm is deterministic, which can hinder a search. A simple way to introduce randomness is adding weights to the savings list. The savings value for each edge can be multiplied with a predetermined weight $w_{ij}$. A randomly generated weight matrix would then allow us to subtly randomize the output without breaking constraints.

\subsection{Neighborhood space}
The neighborhood space for SimpleTabu is constructed from a combination of neighbor operators. A large number of operators have been proposed for the CVRP, for example as seen in \cite{mcnabb2015testing}. In this report, we examine 3 operators:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Relocate: Move a location on a single route;
	\item 2-opt*: Swap two locations on two different routes;
	\item Or-opt: Attach a random segment from one route to another route.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:operators} further illustrates the above operators.

		\caption{Or-opt}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Visualizations of local search operators used by SimpleTabu}
	\label{fig:operators}
\end{figure}

In each search iteration, SimpleTabu generates neighbors using all operators, merges them and samples a fixed-size candidate set from this population.

\chapter{Experiments and results}
\section{Experiment settings}
We shall examine 2 experiments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ablation study: different combinations of neighborhoods are compared, in order to make conclusions on each neighbor's effectiveness;
	\item Comparison: SimpleTabu is compared against two existing methods, ALNS \cite{pisinger2007general} and GRELS \cite{prins2009grasp}.
\end{itemize}

The SimpleTabu algorithm is implemented in Python 3.7, and executed using the PyPy \cite{rigo2006pypy} runtime. All runs are performed on a single 2-core AMD EPYC 2.2Ghz CPU with 4GB RAM.

Experiments are performed using instances from the Christofides et al. dataset \cite{christofides1976vehicle}, which includes 14 CVRP instances of medium size.

Hyperparameters for SimpleTabu are shown in Table \ref{tab:tabu-params}.

\chapter{Conclusion}
This report has given a brief overview of Tabu search in the context of solving CVRP, a fundamental discrete optimization problem. We examined SimpleTabu, a basic implementation that, despite its simplicity, has achieved promising results on the popular CMT dataset. This goes further to show that tabu search can be a powerful search strategy for discrete problems. We also saw that the selection of neighbors can be very crucial to a search algorithm's success.
