\chapter{Introduction}
\section{The capacitated vehicle routing problem}
Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are some of the most well-studied and widely-applied optimization problems. The first definitions of VRP were presented by Dantzig et al. \cite{dantzig1959truck} in 1959. In general, VRPs seek to find an optimal set of tours for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers. This abstraction covers a wide variety of application domains, including transportation, logistics, operations, etc \dots

Since its conception, a number of variants of the VRP have been proposed through the years. These variants account for different constraints as well as optimization goals. Popular VRP variants include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP): vehicles have capacity constraints;
	\item Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW): customers have time windows outside of which they cannot be serviced;
	\item Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits (VRPP): customers have profit values, and may not be serviced;
	\item etc \dots
\end{itemize}

This report focuses on solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem. CVRP is one of the most basic VRP variants. The problem considers a set of $n$ customers, each with a demand value $d_i$. Conversely, each vehicle has a capacity $C$, which is uniform among all vehicles. The CVRP states that no route can have a total demand (the sum of all customers' demands) exceeding the capacity $C$. Vehicle routes always start and end at a pre-determined location, called the depot. We seek a set of $k \leq n$ valid routes such that all customers are serviced \textit{exactly} once, and the total cost is minimized. Commonly, the depot and customer locations are set on a 2D space, where moving from location $A$ to location $B$ incurs a cost equal to the Euclidean distance between $A$ and $B$.
% Figure \ref{fig:prob_example} shows an example of CVRP input and solution.

\section{Formulation}
Formally, the CVRP is defined as (\cite{borcinova2017two}):

\begin{equation}
    min \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0, i \neq j}^n c_{ij}x_{rij} \label{eq:form1}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{align}
    \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i=0,i \neq j}^n x_{rij} = 1 \ & \forall j \in \{1, \dots, n\} \label{eq:form2} \\
    \sum_{j=1}^n x_{r0j} = 1 \ & \forall r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form3} \\
    \sum_{i=0,i \neq j} x_{rij} = \sum_{i=0} x_{rji} \ & \forall j \in \{1, \dots, n\},\ r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form4} \\
    \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=1,i \neq j} d_j x_{rij} \leq Q \ & \forall r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form5} \\
    \sum_{r=1}^p \sum_{i \in S} \sum_{j \in S, i \neq j} x_{rij} \geq |S| - 1 \ & \forall S \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\} \label{eq:form6} \\
    x_{rij} \in \{ 0, 1 \} \ & \forall i,j \in \{0, \dots, n\},\ r \in \{1,\dots,p\} \label{eq:form7}
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = \{0, 1, \dots, n\}$ is the set of locations. $0$ is the depot, where vehicles must start and end their routes;
	\item $p$ is the maximum number of vehicles. If not specified, we can let $p = n$;
	\item $c_{ij}$ is the cost of including edge $(i, j)$ in a route, or the cost incurred when moving from from $i$ to $j$;
	\item $x_{rij}$ is the binary variable signifying whether the edge $(i,j)$ is included in route $r$;
	\item $d_j$ denotes the demand for location $j$;
	\item $Q$ is the vehicle capacity.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Clarke-Wright algorithm}
The Clarke-Wright algorithm, sometimes referred to as the savings algorithm, is a very simple method for generating a valid solution to the CVRP. This is a greedy heuristic that is not optimal, but is often used as the basis for many metaheuristic algorithms.

The Clarke-Wright algorithm defines a savings value for each edge $(i,j)$:
\[
	s_{ij} = c_{i0} + c_{0j} - c_{ij}
\]

An edge's savings value denotes the amount of "cost" that can be saved by replacing two routes, $(0, i, 0)$ and $(0, j, 0)$ with a new route $(0, i, j, 0)$.

The algorithm first calculates the savings for each non-depot edge, then sorts them in a descending order, forming the savings list. $n$ routes are created, each starting at the depot, visits one customer, then returns. Then, the savings list is iterated one-by-one. For each edge $(i, j)$, check for 3 conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $i$ and $j$ must not be on the same route;
	\item $i$ and $j$ must still be connected to the depot on each of their routes;
	\item Merging the routes containing $i$ and $j$ will not violate the capacity constraints.
\end{enumerate}

If all 3 conditions are met, the routes containing $i$ and $j$ are merged, by appending $j$ after $i$ and then returning to the depot.

Each route join in the Clarke-Wright algorithm is guaranteed to improve the solution by the amount of edge savings. However, the greedy ordering is non-optimal, meaning we are likely to skip edges that would otherwise be part of the optimal solution.

\chapter{Tabu search and CVRP}
\section{Tabu search}
Tabu search \cite{glover1986future} is a local search paradigm that uses memory structures to prevent the search from visiting previous solutions.

The main idea in Tabu search is assuming that local minima can be overcome if the search tolerates non-improving solutions, while ignoring (make tabu) previously visited solutions. This mechanism is implemented using a tabu list, containing solutions that have recently been visited by the search. The search excludes these solutions when considering its next move.

\section{SimpleTabu}
This section describes SimpleTabu, a tabu search for solving the CVRP. SimpleTabu is a full tabu search with 3 phases: short-term, intensification, and diversification.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The short-term phase performs a search using only the tabu list, excluding previous moves from the search to avoid local minima;
	\item The intensification phase selects a promising area in the search and explores it further, becoming more lenient with local minima;
	\item The diversification phase tries to move the search to a new, unexplored area, in order to find more promising solutions.
\end{itemize}

The search procedure starts with an initial solution. The short-term phase is run first, in which long-term memory objects are updated. Upon termination, a new initial solution is selected to start the intensification phase. After this phase, another initial solution is created for diversification.

\subsection{Initialization}
SimpleTabu uses the Clarke-Wright algorithm to create its initial solution. However, the original Clarke-Wright algorithm is deterministic, which can hinder a search. A simple way to introduce randomness is adding weights to the savings list. The savings value for each edge can be multiplied with a predetermined weight $w_{ij}$. A randomly generated weight matrix would then allow us to subtly randomize the output without breaking constraints.

\subsection{Neighborhood space}
The neighborhood space for SimpleTabu is constructed from a combination of neighbor operators. A large number of operators have been proposed for the CVRP, for example as seen in \cite{mcnabb2015testing}. In this report, we examine 3 operators:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Relocate: Move a location on a single route;
	\item 2-opt*: Swap two locations on two different routes;
	\item Or-opt: Attach a random segment from one route to another route.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:operators} further illustrates the above operators.

\begin{figure}[ht]

		\caption{Or-opt}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Visualizations of local search operators used by SimpleTabu}
	\label{fig:operators}
\end{figure}

In each search iteration, SimpleTabu generates neighbors using all operators, merges them and samples a fixed-size candidate set from this population.

\subsection{Intensification}
The intensification phase seeks to further explore a promising search region for quality solutions. We can reasonably assume that the neighborhood space of a good solution can be promising for this phase.

To select the solution from which intensification begins, SimpleTabu maintains an \textit{elite set}, containing $\lambda$ best solutions in the search so far. At each search iteration (for any phase), if the current solution outperforms a solution in the elite set, it is inserted in the set. Worst solutions are removed from the set, similar to a circular buffer implementation. At the start of intensification, a solution is randomly chosen from the elite set as the initial solution.

\subsection{Diversification}
Diversification seeks to explore a new area of the search space, in order to avoid local minima. Finding this new area can be tricky, as we need to generate a solution as different from all previous solutions as possible. To achieve this, SimpleTabu maintains a frequency matrix for all possible edges that can appear in a solution. We can track the number of times each edge has appeared in a search iteration (in all phases). This frequency is used to control the Clarke-Wright algorithm via an inverse matrix $IW$:
\[
	IW_{ij} = 1 - \frac{F_{ij}}{\sum F}
\]

$IW$ is used as the edge weights, meaning edges that appear more frequently have their savings value decreased more, reducing the likelihood that they are chosen. The solution generated from this procedure is used as the initial solution for diversification.

% \subsection{Stop conditions}
% Each phase runs for a maximum number of iterations. Additionally, if a phase fails to improve the solution for too many iterations, we declare that it has converged and stops early.

\section{Related works}
A vast number of studies have explored methods of solving the CVRP. Cordeau et al. \cite{cordeau2005new} presented a comprehensive survey of various approaches, including local search, evolutionary algorithms and learning-based methods. Reimann et al. \cite{reimann2004d} propsed an ACO-based method for large-scale VRPs. Pisinger et al. \cite{pisinger2007general} proposed a large neighborhood search method (ALNS) for solving a variety of VRP problems (including CVRP, VRPTW, etc). Different problem types are transformed into the Rich Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows. The search is adaptive, where each iteration selects a "destroy" neighborhood and a "repair" neighborhood to advance the current solution. Prins et al. \cite{prins2009grasp} proposed $GRASP \times ELS$, a hybrid between the GRASP framework (consisting of multiple restarts and search with mutations) and evolutionary local search (ELS).

Many benchmark datasets have also been published to help evaluate these approaches. The most commonly used dataset is the Christofides CMT dataset \cite{christofides1976vehicle}. For very large instances, the Golden \cite{golden1998metaheuristics} dataset is also frequently used.

\chapter{Experiments and results}
\section{Experiment settings}
We shall examine 2 experiments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ablation study: different combinations of neighborhoods are compared, in order to make conclusions on each neighbor's effectiveness;
	\item Comparison: SimpleTabu is compared against two existing methods, ALNS \cite{pisinger2007general} and GRELS \cite{prins2009grasp}.
\end{itemize}

The SimpleTabu algorithm is implemented in Python 3.7, and executed using the PyPy \cite{rigo2006pypy} runtime. All runs are performed on a single 2-core AMD EPYC 2.2Ghz CPU with 4GB RAM.

Experiments are performed using instances from the Christofides et al. dataset \cite{christofides1976vehicle}, which includes 14 CVRP instances of medium size.

Hyperparameters for SimpleTabu are shown in Table \ref{tab:tabu-params}. The implementation of SimpleTabu can be found at: \href{https://github.com/lanPN85/meta-cvrp}{https://github.com/lanPN85/meta-cvrp}

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Ablation study}
This experiment aims to highlight the effects of each search neighborhood to the final solution. We examine 4 neighborhood variants of SimpleTabu, namely: SimpleTabu with all 3 neighborhoods; SimpleTabu without Or-opt; SimpleTabu without 2-opt* and SimpleTabu without Relocate.

Results are shown in Table \ref{ tab:compare-abl-cmt }. The full variant performs best in the majority of test instances. The no Or-opt variant also performs quite well, achieving the best solutions on 4 instances, while also showing more stability. This implies that Or-opt can produce a lot of randomness to the search, causing more variance in the final result. The no 2-opt* variant produces similar results. Finally, the no Relocate variant is the worst performing on all instances, while also being highly unstable. This shows that Relocate, while a very simple neighborhood, plays a large part in guiding and improving the Tabu search.

\input{tables/compare_cmt_abl.tex}

\subsection{Comparison to existing methods}
In this section, we look at SimpleTabu's performance compared to 2 other methods: ALNS \cite{pisinger2007general} and GRELS \cite{prins2009grasp}.

\input{tables/compare_cmt_others.tex}

Results are shown in Table \ref{ tab:compare-others-cmt }. In general, GRELS produces the best results on the majority of instances, with ALNS being a close second. Somewhat surprisingly, SimpleTabu achieves the best results on 4 instances in the dataset, despite being a more simple, basic approach.

	\label{fig:time}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:converge} shows the convergence charts for 2 runs of SimpleTabu. We can see that diversification plays a big part in the final result, as moving to a new search region often finds more optimal solutions.

Figure \ref{fig:time} shows the average execution time for SimpleTabu. This value generally correlates with the instance size, and maxes out at about 5000s for instance CMT05.

\chapter{Conclusion}
This report has given a brief overview of Tabu search in the context of solving CVRP, a fundamental discrete optimization problem. We examined SimpleTabu, a basic implementation that, despite its simplicity, has achieved promising results on the popular CMT dataset. This goes further to show that tabu search can be a powerful search strategy for discrete problems. We also saw that the selection of neighbors can be very crucial to a search algorithm's success.
